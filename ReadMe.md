# Wallpaper Changer

This is just a repository of two application I will include that do the same thing just in different languages for both Windows and Linux. One of the applications will be written in C# and the other one in Python.

There is ~~going to be a online and~~ offline mode that you can select a folder and the interval in which it will change the wallpaper automatically for you.

As of now I am almost done with the C# application, I just need to polish some things there and there and also make it in such a way that it will stay open after you close the application in the hidden icons on windows platforms.
